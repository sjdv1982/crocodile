The make-rotaconformers script uses Seamless to builds rotaconformer library from a trinucleotide fragment library in a reproducible manner.

In essence, make-rotaconformers enumerates all possible rotations of each conformer within a library.

The script comes in two versions. The make-rotaconformers.py version submits all jobs inside the main Python code.
The make-rotaconformers-nested.py wraps the job submissions themselves inside a job (i.e. a Seamless transformation).
This second version will complete instantly is the computation is already done, and the code is also better annotated.

The "results/" directory contains the Seamless (SHA3-256) checksums of all rotaconformers generated from a
of a fragment library with the following checksums:

The input fragment library (conformer) files can be found in /home/sdevries/fragment-library on the MBI cluster. This library was previously built with ProtNAff (<https://github.com/isaureCdB/ProtNAff>)
ProtNAff (commit 1ef1d6324303a0b0aa41445c2214d17abe1bfe35) was run on its bundled list of PDB codes "all.list",
and then the ProtNAff script "build-library.sh" was run.
